Required functions: list and briefly describe the functions you wrote to satisfy the various
parts of the project (as listed above, in their respective sections)

Status: Are all your functions working correctly, or are some incomplete or have bugs that
you know of? Please give us your assessment, to help us as we review your code (so we donâ€™t
waste time trying to puzzle out how something is working if it is incomplete or buggy).

I am pretty sure that everything works
